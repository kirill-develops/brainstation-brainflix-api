# BrainFlix
### Node.js/Express back-end API
*is a YouTube emulator created during the Web Development bootcamp @BrainStation*


With a 3 week timeframe broken into 3 sprints, we built out the front-end React SPA using create-react-app, react-router and Sass. During sprint 2 we built on state & data fetching concepts by leveraging class components and integrating Axios into Reactâ€™s lifecycle methods. Finally we complemented the site with a Node/Express API server following a MVC architecture to separate concerns and scalability.

Below are instructions on how to install the Node/Express API and you can [Click here](https://github.com/kirill-develops/kirill-tchentsov-brainflix-spa) to find the front-end React.js SPA Repo and the remaining steps.

Thank you for stopping by! ðŸŽ¥ðŸŒŸ
